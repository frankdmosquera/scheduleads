### F-32 [P3] unverified - A pick is the package's display name, so a renamed holiday would take a business's booking page down

**File:** backend/lib/bookable-hours/closed-holidays.ts:58
**Found:** 2026-09-28 by /audit independent (scope: current; lens: quality)
**Why it matters:** `closedHolidays` stores `date-holidays`' English display
names (`"Thanksgiving"`, `"St. Patrick’s Day"` with a typographic apostrophe),
and a name the list no longer has throws, as step 2.6 piece 4 decided. The
throw propagates out of `applyBookableHoursRules` and the public detail route
answers `500` for that business until its row is corrected. The names are not a
stable identifier: the dependency is `^3.37.0`, so a lockfile refresh can pull
a minor release that renames or drops a holiday, and a province can abolish
one, after which every business that picked it loses its public booking page,
not just that one closure. The saved tests pin the nine Alberta names and
National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, so a rename of those would fail the
tests on upgrade; any other name a feature 12 picker offers would not. Not
observed: no rename exists in 3.37.0, and the probe found no name that differs
in date between Alberta's list and the national one in 2026 to 2030, for any
province.
**Suggested fix:** Decide in feature 12, when the picker writes names: either
validate picks against the list at write time and keep a test over every name
the picker can offer, or store a stable key (the package's `rule` string) with
the display name. Worth a note on feature 12 now so it is not rediscovered.
**Resolution:** Carried to feature 12 on Frank's call, 2026-09-28, noted on
item 12 in `build-plan.md`. Stays unverified until then.

### F-47 [P3] open - The spec says accepting an invitation is refused, but Better Auth checks no role for it

**File:** blueprint/context/current-feature.md:328
**Found:** 2026-09-30 by /audit independent (scope: step 3b.2; lens: security)
**Why it matters:** Data / contracts says `invite-member` "(and accepting
one): refused, no role holds an invitation permission". Better Auth 1.7.5's
`/organization/accept-invitation` checks only that the invitation is pending,
unexpired and addressed to the signed-in user (`crud-invites.mjs:264-268`), never
the inviter's or anyone's role. Closing `invitation` stops new invitations, so
accepting is closed in practice only once no pending one exists. An invitation
made before this change stays acceptable until it expires (48 hours by
default), and its acceptance puts a client in a second business. Real clients
cannot reach the product yet, so the live risk is close to nil.
**Suggested fix:** Reword the contract line (accepting is closed because no
invitation can be made any more), and before the first client-facing deploy
confirm the production `invitation` table holds no pending row.
**Resolution:**
Carried on Frank's call, 2026-09-30: checked on the live database before the first client-facing deploy (the `invitation` table must be empty, or its rows cancelled). Nothing in code to change.
